NAME
    mutex -- Low-level synchronization based on the thread API

SYNOPSIS
    local mutex = require("mutex")

    -- Create a new mutex.
    local m = mutex.new()

    -- Acquire and release exclusive ownership.
    m:lock()
    m:unlock()

    -- Acquire and release shared ownership.
    m:lock_shared()
    m:unlock_shared()

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a multiple-reader, single-writer mutex.

CONSTRUCTOR
    mutex.new(): mutex
        Create a mutex. At most one thread can have exclusive
        ownership, and if any thread does have exclusive ownership, no
        other threads can have shared or exclusive
        ownership. Alternatively, many threads may have shared
        ownership.

METHODS
    m:lock([timeout: number]): boolean
        Acquire exclusive ownership. The current thread blocks until
        ownership can be obtained. A thread that already has exclusive
        ownership of a given instance of mutex can call this function
        to acquire an additional level of ownership of the
        mutex. m:unlock() must be called for each level of ownership
        acquired by a single thread before ownership can be acquired
        by another thread.

        Return true on sucess, or false when timed out.

    m:unlock(): void
        Release exclusive ownership owned by the current thread.

    m:lock_shared([timeout: number]): boolean
        Like m:lock() but instead acquire shared ownership.

    m:unlock_shared()
        Like :unlock() but instead release shared ownership.
