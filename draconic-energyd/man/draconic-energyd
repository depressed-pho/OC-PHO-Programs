NAME
    draconic-energyd -- Draconic Evolution energy storage monitor daemon

SYNOPSIS
    draconic-energyd [-f] [-c file]
    draconic-energyd status
    draconic-energyd stop

DESCRIPTION
    This program is a daemon to be controlled by
    `/etc/rc.d/draconic-energyd', and users are not expected to run it
    directly. It may take the following options:

    -f       Run as a foreground process and also enables debugging output.

    -c file  Use the specified file instead of the default configuration file.

    status   Show the status of currently running daemon if any.

    stop     Stop currently running daemon if any.

CONFIGURATION
    This program uses Kilobyte's configparser library. The file may contain
    the following options:

    port     Port number on which the daemon listens for connections,
             default 7272.

EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION
    # The port number.
    port 7272;

SETTING UP
    In order to monitor an energy storage, one must place an Adapter
    block right next to an Energy Pylon and then connect it to the
    computer. There may be arbitrary many energy storages monitored by
    a single daemon.

NETWORKING PROTOCOL
    This program uses the Minitel networking stack to listen on a
    socket for incoming connections. Upon establishing a connection,
    the client is expected to send out RPC messages to the server
    ("C:" and "S:" indicates the direction of messages):

        C: {openrpc="1.0", method="list-energy-storages", id=1}
        S: {openrpc="1.0", result={"xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx", "yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy"}, id=1}
        C: {openrpc="1.0", method="get-energy-storage", params={"xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"}, id=2}
        S: {openrpc="1.0", result={energyStored=1099511627776, ...}, id=2}

    The RPC protocol is described in another man page
    `openrpc'. Currently defined RPC methods are as follows:

    "list-energy-storages"
        Parameters:
            none
        Result value:
            List of component addresses.
        Error codes:
            none
        Description:
            Get the list of all the energy storages connected to the
            server.

    "get-energy-storage"
        Parameters:
            An array consisting of a single component address pointing
            to an energy storage.
        Result value:
            {
                energyStored    = <number>, -- RF
                maxEnergyStored = <number>, -- RF
                transferPerTick = <number>  -- RF/t
            }
        Error codes:
            * 1: Energy storage not found.
        Description:
            Retrieve information about an energy storage.

FILES
    /etc/draconic-energyd.conf  default configuration file.
