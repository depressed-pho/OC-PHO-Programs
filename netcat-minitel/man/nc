NAME
    nc -- Command-line utility for reading and writing data across
          minitel network

SYNOPSIS
    nc -h
    nc --help
    nc [-urdv] [--output=FILE] [--mtu=NUM] [--wait=NUM] HOST PORT
    nc [-urdv] [--output=FILE] [--mtu=NUM] [--wait=NUM] -l PORT

DESCRIPTION
    nc (netcat) allows you to use minitel network
    (reliable/unreliable, ordered/unordered, stream/datagram) from the
    shell.

    For connecting to remote hosts, it's usually only necessary to
    supply the host and port for the connection. For listening on a
    socket, you must specify `-l' for listening, and port to specify
    the port on which you want to listen.

    The options are as follows (with C and S indicating whether the
    option applies to the "client" or "server" roles in a
    conversation):

    -h, --help
        Display a short help message.

    -u, --unreliable
        (CS) Select unreliable datagram transport as opposed to
        reliable ordered stream (the default).

    -r, --reliable
        (CS) Select reliable unordered datagram transport as opposed
        to stream (the default).

    -d, --ordered
        (CS) Select reliable ordered datagram transport as opposed to
        stream (the default).

    -v, --verbose
        (CS) Turn on verbosity.

    -l, --listen
        (S) Select "listen" mode instead of connect mode so that
        clients can connect to the socket nc listens on.

    --output=FILE
        (CS) Send a dump of the traffic to the specified file.

    --mtu=NUM
        (CS) Specify the maximum packet size to be sent without
        getting fragmented.

    --wait=NUM
        (C) Specify the time in seconds to wait for a response while
        trying to establish a connection.
