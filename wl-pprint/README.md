# wl-pprint

This package provides a functional pretty printer given by Philip
Wadler and Daan Leijen:
[ansi-wl-pprint](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ansi-wl-pprint).

## Modules

* [wl-pprint](man/wl-pprint)

## Supported OSes

This package is OS-independent and should work on any OpenComputers
OSes, except for Unicode support which requires OpenOS. But due to the
current limitation of OC, most of SGR commands don't work at all. In
particular, none of OC GPUs can display bold or underlined characters.
