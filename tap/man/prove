NAME
    prove -- Run tests through a TAP harness

SYNOPSIS
    prove [options] [--] [files or directories]

DESCRIPTION
    The "prove" command runs TAP test programs and parses the
    result. Test programs are expected to write TAP results to stdout,
    and diagnosis messages to stderr.

    See also "tap/test" for writing TAP tests.

OPTIONS
    MISCELLANEOUS
        -h             print help message
            --help     show this man page
        -v, --verbose  print all test lines
        -D, --dry      show tests that would have run, without actually running

    SELECTING TESTS TO RUN
        -r, --recurse  recursively descend into directories

EXIT CODE
    If any of the tests fail "prove" will exit with non-zero
    status. Otherwise it exits with 0.

EXAMPLES

        % prove /usr/test/*.lua

    Run all tests under "/usr/test".

        % prove -r /usr/test

    Run all tests under "/usr/test" including ones that are in
    subdirectories.
